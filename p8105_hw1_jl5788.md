# Problem 1

#### Data Frame

``` r
data_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp >0,
  character_vector = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  type = factor(c("positive","zero","negative","positive","zero","negative","positive","zero","negative","positive"), levels = c("positive","zero","negative"))
)
```

##### 1. Caculate the mean of the first variable of dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(data_df,norm_samp))
```

Success! The result is -0.0264663.

##### 2. Caculate the mean of the second variable of dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(data_df,norm_samp_pos))
```

Success! The result is 0.4.

##### 3. Caculate the mean of the third variable of dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(data_df,character_vector))
```

Failure! The result is NA.

##### 4. Caculate the mean of the forth variable of dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(data_df,type))
```

Failure! The result is NA.

#### When using as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables, what will happen?

``` r
as.numeric(3>2)
```

Success! The result is 1. Output is 1 because logical variable True
equal to 1. On the contrary, if logical variable is False, as.numeric
function results to 0.

``` r
as.numeric("character")
```

The result is NA and in the Console,it writes warning message. Because
“character” (character variable) cannot equal to any numeric variable
like “1”(character variable) equal to 1 (numeric variable), so it just
shows NA indicating it has been forced to transform character variables
to numeric variables NA.

``` r
as.numeric(factor("good","bad"))
```

The result is NA. The reason is the same as shows above.

#### Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?

These three code chunks above and results they showed help explain what
happens when try to take the mean. Because when we use as.numeric()
function to transform character vector and factor vector to numeric
vector, the results are both NA and we cannot caculate the average of
NA, which is meaningless, so Console reports an error when we try it.

#### Short description of the penguins dataset

1.  The names of the data in this dataset are species, island,
    bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
    body\_mass\_g, sex, year.
2.  There are 344 rows and 8 columns in this dataset.
3.  There are 3 speices of penguins, which are Adelie, Gentoo,
    Chinstrap.
4.  They live in 3 islands, which are Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream.
5.  The mean of flipper length is 200.9152047.

#### Scatterplot of flipper\_length\_mm (y) vs bill\_length\_mm (x)

``` r
pen_plot = ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +geom_point()
ggsave("pen_plot.pdf")
```
